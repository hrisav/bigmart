# BigMart Dataset

The data has been split into two groups:

training set (Train_BigMart.csv) test set (Test_BigMart.csv)

Here I have tried applying KNR and GridSearchCV to check to find out for which value of K the model gives the least Mean Square Error. Finally on test data, I have predicted values of Item_Outlet_Sales, whose mean score we got as 2160.83
